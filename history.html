                           In September 1935, Qian Hesen and other 20 G-fee officials stayed in the United States for free from Shanghai to take the ship of President Jackson to Seattle, the United States.

                           Only on the list of people attending the communal dinner of communist party organized by Qian Xuesen in his early years, the FBI accused him of deliberately denying joining the periphery of the Communist Party in filing for naturalization. The Ministry of Justice revoked his confidential work permit and deported him on charges of "perjury". On August 30, 1950, the United States Department of Justice, Qian Xuesen, temporarily detained in Tempranhos prison for 15 days.

                           In 1955, after a few months of bilateral talks in Geneva between the two governments, Qian Xuesen was released by the U.S. government, [30] in exchange for U.S. pilots captured in the Korean war. On September 17, Qian Hsueshen boarded the Presidential Cleveland (SS Pres. Cleveland, named after Grover Cleveland) of U.S. President Lines and arrived in Beijing, China on October 28 through Hong Kong.
